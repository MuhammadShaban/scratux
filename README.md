# Scratux 
Scratux is a simple project that aims to provide Free/Libre Open Source Linux binaries of Scratch Desktop

Since the official Scratch project does not provide binaries for Linux distributions, we created this project so you do not have to download + build from source. Just click and install it.

Scratux is built-in different languages and is always based on the latest Scratch release. (Currently Scratch 3.0)
