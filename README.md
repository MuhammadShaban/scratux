# Scratux 
Scratux is a block-based visual programming language targeted primarily at children. Users can create projects using a block-like interface. With Scratux, you can program your own interactive stories, games, and animations â€” and share your creations with others in the online community.

Basically Scratux is a simple project that aims to provide Free/Libre Open Source Linux binaries of Scratch Desktop. So consider it as the unofficial Scratch for Linux ;)

Since the official Scratch project does not provide binaries for Linux distributions, we created this project so you do not have to download + build from source. Just click and install it.

Scratux is built-in different languages and is always based on the latest Scratch release. (Currently Scratch 3.0)
